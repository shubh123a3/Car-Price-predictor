## Project Overview

Predicting car prices is a complex task that involves analyzing a multitude of factors. This project leverages the power of machine learning, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, to build an accurate and robust car price prediction model.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.
- Model Training: Using Random Forest to train the model on the processed dataset.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using various metrics.
- Application: Deploying the model for real-time car price prediction.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following libraries:

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualizations)
- seaborn (for visualizations)
- Flask (for deployment)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn Flask
```

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is not included in the repository. You can download it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or use your own dataset with similar features.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Loading Data**: Importing the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Filling or dropping missing values to ensure data consistency.
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converting categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
4. **Scaling Numerical Features**: Normalizing numerical features to improve model performance.

## Feature Engineering

1. **Creating New Features**: Generating additional features from existing ones to capture more information for the model.
2. **Feature Selection**: Selecting the most relevant features to use for model training.

## Model Training

1. **Model Selection**: Using Random Forest for its robustness and accuracy.
2. **Training the Model**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and training the Random Forest model.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to improve performance.

## Model Evaluation

1. **Performance Metrics**: Evaluating the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score.
2. **Cross-Validation**: Performing cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Application

### Running the Application

The `app.py` script is used to deploy the trained model using Flask. To run the application:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

```bash
cd car-price-predictor
```

2. **Run the Flask Application**:

```bash
python app.py
```

3. **Access the Application**:

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to use the car price predictor.
